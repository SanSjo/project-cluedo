`PROJECT 5`

# Build a piece of Cluedo

In this weekâ€™s project we creates a piece of the famous board game "Cluedo". The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.  

The focus on this project was to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

This weeks project includes all the requirement and some of the stretch goals, such as making it responsive, styling the page, adding images to suspects and weapons and also adding alert if you click the reveal button before clicking the cards.

I also made the "reveal mystery" text replacing the cards so the cards becomes non visible when clicking the reveal button. And I made a button to reload the page to get the cards back again so the game can start over.

I struggled with styling the reveal mystery text, I didnt manage to style the text with media query. So the text is not responsive, but it works anyway. I also struggled with how to make the alert pop up if you only pick one card and then the reveal button.

Otherwise i'm happy with what I accomplished, and I'm happy that I solved almost everything on my own.
